# Install Grafana and Prometheus on CentOS 7 #

Although Prometheus is very good at collection, alerting and searching for metrics. But it does not include a native tool for creating custom dashboards. Although, we can create custom dashboards for the metrics collected by Prometheus by using another free and open source software i.e. Grafana.

Grafana is a free and open-source, general-purpose graph and dashboard composer. It supports many third party software applications such as Prometheus, PNP, InfluxDB, Graphite, etc. Grafana runs as a web application at default port 3000/tcp.

In this article, we are installing Grafana and Prometheus on CentOS 7. And we will use Grafana Web UI to create a dashboard for Prometheus metrics.

Prometheus: Up & Running by O'Reilly Media is a recommended book for the sysadmins, who want to learn more about creating dashboards in Grafana for Prometheus metrics.
